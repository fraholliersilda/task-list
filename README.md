Developed a task management application using Laravel, enabling users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The project follows the MVC architecture, ensuring clean and maintainable code. Tailwind CSS was used for a modern and responsive UI, while Alpine.js was integrated for interactive messages and dynamic UI feedback. Currently, the application allows all users to manage tasks in a shared environment, but an authentication and authorization system is in development to ensure each user has their own personalized task list. This project enhances both backend and frontend skills while leveraging Laravelâ€™s ecosystem for future scalability.
